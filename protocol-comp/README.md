# Protocol Component

## Testing
Click [here](http://207.154.210.124:8080/) to test online.

To run locally, the [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) has to be installed. Install **dependencies** separately for the **dev-server** and the **protocol-comp** front. The dev-server is used to provide dummy endpoints for `fsms.json` and `protocols.json`. Run in development mode with:
- `node server.js` in *./dev-server*
- `npm run serve` in *./protocol-comp*

## Features
- `auto-load` protocols.json and fsms.json
- `create` new block-definitions and parent-block-definitions
- `remove` block-definitions and parent-block-definitions
- `duplicate` block-definitions and parent-block-definitions
- `expand` or `minimize` elements
- `ensure` uniqueness of user-defined names
- `instantiate` with drag and drop
  - fsm-template --> block-definition, instantiates a `trial`
  - block-definition --> parent-block-definition, instantiates a `block`
  - block-definition --> protocol-template, instantiates a `block`
  - parent-block-definition --> protocol-template, instantiates a `parent-block`
  - parent-block-definition --> parent-block-definition, instantiates a `parent-block`
- `maintain` position in which an item was dropped in
- `sort` all items in a definition (re-order-able)
- `remove` items of a definition
- `auto-update` all instances of a definition if the definition is mutated (removal/addition of items or re-ordering)
- `notify` user, that the mutation of a definition affects all its instances as well
- `prompt` user to set all values for trial instantiation (`fsm-variables, name, blocking, description`)
- `set variable info` on trial instantiation (`transition`, `event_idx`, `variable_idx`, `value`)
- `prevent` self assignments
- `mark` valid drop zones while dragging elements
- `inspect` underlying JSON structure of definitions/templates
- `auto-label` and `flatten` exports as specified in `subjects.schema.json`
- `export` `subjects.json` when configuration is finished
- `save` or `clear` current configuration state to/from localStorage (helps while testing)
- `validation` and `visual feedback` of the generated output (subjects.json against subjects.schema.json)


## Under Construction
- the mutation of a definition does not yet prompt the user to `choose` between changing the definition and all its instances or creating a new definition with these mutations
  - for now, the user is just notified that the mutation has affected all instances
- integration of `monaco-editor` for schema-validation and auto-suggestions
  - a provisional textarea is used
- set default `blocking` state to `true` if item is the last one in a block
  - in which state should this be checked? On export? Trials inside a block-instance can be changed, which could result in a new last element.

## Bugs
- not all elements are draggable after state retrieval from `localStorage`
